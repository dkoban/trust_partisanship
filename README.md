# Trust in Public Health Institutions Moderates the Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccine Discusion Groups

## Research Aims

- 1. [ETL](https://github.com/dkoban/trust_partisanship/blob/main/etl.ipynb): data pre-processing and filtering.

- 2. [Factor Anaylsis](https://github.com/dkoban/trust_partisanship/blob/main/factor_analysis.ipynb): explores how to operationalized variables of interest.

- 3. [Model Evaluation](https://github.com/dkoban/trust_partisanship/blob/main/model_eval.ipynb): provides diagnostic plots of residual distributions.

- 4. [Sample Characteristics](https://github.com/dkoban/trust_partisanship/blob/main/sample_characteristics.ipynb): provides summary statistics of demographics stratified by group and variables of interest.

- 5. [Subgroup Analysis](https://github.com/dkoban/trust_partisanship/blob/main/subgroup_analysis.ipynb): workflow for estimated treatment effects and plotting with 95% confidence intervals.

- 6. [Moderation Analysis](https://github.com/dkoban/trust_partisanship/blob/main/moderation_analysis.ipynb): workflow to test for interactions between group and variables of interest.
